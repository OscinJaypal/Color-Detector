# Color-Detector
The Color Detector project involves creating a system that identifies and names colors in images using Python libraries. This project can be useful for applications in design, digital art, and accessibility tools. The below given is the description of how such a system works:

1.	Data Collection and Preparation:
Color Dataset: Create or obtain a dataset containing color names and their corresponding RGB values. This dataset serves as the reference for identifying and naming colors.
2.	Image Processing:
   Loading Images: Use Python libraries such as OpenCV or PIL (Pillow) to load images into the system.
   Pixel Extraction: Extract pixel data from the images to analyze their color composition. This can be done by iterating over each pixel or selecting specific regions of interest.
3.	Color Detection Algorithm:
   	Color Matching: For each pixel or selected region, compare the RGB values with the reference color dataset to find the closest match. This can be done using a distance metric such as Euclidean distance to determine the similarity between colors.
   	Color Naming: Assign the name of the closest matching color from the reference dataset to the pixel or region being analyzed.
4.	Visualization and Output:
   	Annotating Images: Use OpenCV or PIL to draw rectangles, circles, or other shapes around detected colors in the image and label them with the corresponding color names.
  	Displaying Results: Show the annotated image with color names using OpenCV’s imshow function or save the output image using PIL’s save method.
5.	User Interaction:
   	Interactive Tools: Create interactive tools using libraries like OpenCV’s mouse event handling to allow users to click on parts of the image and get the color name of the selected area.
   	Graphical User Interface (GUI): Develop a simple GUI using libraries such as Tkinter or PyQt to provide a user-friendly interface for loading images, detecting colors, and displaying results.

Python Libraries Used:
•	OpenCV: For image loading, processing, and displaying results.
•	PIL (Pillow): For image manipulation and saving results.
•	NumPy: For efficient numerical operations and handling pixel data.
•	Tkinter/PyQt: For creating a graphical user interface (optional).

Example Workflow:
1.	Load Image: Load an image using OpenCV or PIL.
2.	Extract Pixels: Extract RGB values of pixels from the image.
3.	Match Colors: Compare extracted RGB values with the reference dataset to find the closest color match.
4.	Annotate Image: Draw shapes and label detected colors on the image.
5.	Display/Save Image: Display the annotated image using OpenCV or save it using PIL.

This color detector project demonstrates the practical application of image processing and computer vision techniques, providing a useful tool for identifying and naming colors in various types of images.
